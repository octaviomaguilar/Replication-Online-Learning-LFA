This folder contains all the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data. I do not include the raw ATUS data file due to its large size. Instead, I include the clean data.
If you wish to pull the raw data please visit the IPUMS-ATUS website (https://www.atusdata.org/atus/) and extract the necessary variables.
